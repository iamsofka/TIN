                <div class="text">
                    Let's be honest, the dutch may be weirs, so do their toppings for toasts, toasts in generel, all other dishes, 0.33 beers, etc. 
                    But today I want to pay your attention on 3 most popular toast toppings.

                <h2>Hagelslag</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    Let’s begin with the classic: <a href="https://www.thespruceeats.com/hagelslag-history-varieties-and-uses-1128744">hagelslag</a>. Perhaps the greatest and most unique of all Dutch bread toppings, hagelslag is every child’s holy grail. It hasn’t been scientifically confirmed yet, but this Dutch delicacy is the only (okay, so maybe not the only) reason that Dutch children are among the happiest in the world.
                    The legendary status of hagelslag has spread across the world to solidify the opinion of the Dutch being straight-up crazy, but that’s based solely on the belief that hagelslag is just chocolate sprinkles. What people often don’t realize is that Dutchies have different types of hagelslag. And I mean a lot of different types.

                <h2>Muisjes</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisjes">Muisjes</a> literally translates to mice, and frankly, it’s one of the stranger additions to this list of Dutch bread toppings. Essentially they’re little balls of anise covered in a sugar-coating. Think of them like mini M&M’s, but with anise instead of chocolate on the inside. The sugar-coating is also significantly tougher.
                    For the Dutch, though, this topping means more than just sugary goodness. Traditionally, when a baby is born, muisjes are presented on biscuits to baby visitors and distributed at work and school as ‘traktatie‘ (treat).

This has been happening as far back as the 17th century! For boys, this means blue and white muisjes and for girls, it’s pink and white muisjes. Given the increasing acceptance of gender neutrality and fluidity, however, I’m wondering how long the current colour scheme will last.

                <h2>Kroket</h2>
                <div class="text">
                    The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croquette">kroket</a> is a strange food to list as a Dutch bread topping because it’s also frequently eaten as a standalone dish, but in true Dutch fashion, we’ve decided to put it on our bread anyway. There isn’t really much that compares to it (except for maybe bitterballen, but the kroket shape is just more convenient).
                    If you’ve never had kroket before, just imagine a delicious warm ragout covered in a crunchy layer of goodness. Now, if you have that in mind, just add mustard and a layer of soft white bread. White bread is the go-to bread type for a kroket boterham (although my personal preference is a ciabatta). So, there you have it: kroket as a Dutch bread topping.
