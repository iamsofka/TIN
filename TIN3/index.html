		<h2>General information</h2>
        Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the southern hemisphere: 
        only one species, the Gal√°pagos penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, 
        penguins have countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
			<blockquote>
				In general today, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, and smaller penguins inhabit regions with 
                temperate or tropical climates. Some prehistoric penguin species were enormous: as tall or heavy as an 
                adult human.

        The evolutionary history of penguins is well-researched and represents a showcase of evolutionary biogeography.

			Although penguin bones of any one species vary much in size and few good specimens are known, the alpha taxonomy of many prehistoric forms still leaves much to be desired. The basal penguins lived around the time of the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event somewhere in the general area of (southern) New Zealand and Byrd Land, Antarctica.Due to plate tectonics, these areas were at that time less than 1,500 kilometres (930 mi) apart rather than the 4,000 kilometres (2,500 mi) of today.

		<h2>Geography </h2>
        The geographical and temporal pattern of spheniscine evolution corresponds closely to two episodes of global cooling documented in the paleoclimatic record.
        The emergence of the Subantarctic lineage at the end of the Bartonian corresponds with the onset of the slow period of cooling that eventually led to the ice ages some 35 million years later. With habitat on the Antarctic coasts declining, by the Priabonian more hospitable conditions for most penguins existed in the Subantarctic regions rather than in Antarctica itself.
        Notably, the cold Antarctic Circumpolar Current also started as a continuous circumpolar flow only around 30 mya, on the one hand forcing the Antarctic cooling, and on the other facilitating the eastward expansion of Spheniscus to South America and eventually beyond. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, 
        squid and other forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their 
        lives on land and the other half in the sea.

		<h2>Penguins and humans</h2>
        Penguins are widely considered endearing for their unusually upright, waddling gait, swimming ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans.

            Penguins featured regularly in the cartoons of U.K. cartoonist Steve Bell in his strip in The Guardian newspaper, particularly during and following the Falklands War. Opus the Penguin, from the cartoons of Berkeley Breathed, is also described as hailing from the Falklands.
